    <h1>Enjoyable Baked Ziti Recipe</h1>

    <p>Baked Ziti isn't something I always think to make, but when I DO make it, I am so glad I did! <br />
    It's very much a comfort food, best for when you're not TOO worried about your calorie intake for the day. ;)

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 lb Sausage</li>
        <li>1 Onion</li>
        <li>Ziti Noodles</li>
    </ul>    

<h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, prepare the meat by cooking it in a skillet.</li>
        <li>Next, begin to boil the noodles.</li>
        <li>Finally, once both of the above steps are done, put these 2, meat and cheese into a pan and bake at 350 for 40 minutes.</li>

    </ol>
